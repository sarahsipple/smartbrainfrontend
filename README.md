# Smart Brain Face Recognition App

Connected with Clarifai AI API  to create an app that puts a box around a face of an image. Once a user is registered and logged in, they can paste a link to an image and the AI will detect where the face is. The smart-brain will put a box around the detected face for visual confirmation. The count at the top of the screen to let the user know how many faces they have detected.

Used React JS, HTML and CSS for front-end, and Node.JS and PostgreSQL for back-end log-in functionality.
